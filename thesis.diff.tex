	\section*{Introduction}	

	If I have done anything right this paper should be easy to read. I
	think that is the kindest thing a writer can do. If I have
	done anything right this paper should also not be quite like anything 
	you have seen before. I might say that is the second kindest thing a 
	writer can do.  

	In the spirit of easy reading, here's a summary of what lies ahead:

	This is a paper about the ecologies of attention and understanding 
	evident in and emergent from the presentation of classical music on the
	classic children's television program \textit{Sesame Street.}  
	The paper takes three parts. The first part is an analysis of context,
	attention, and education on the program, framed through the analogy of
	bird-watching. I argue that the classical music education which is 
	presented on the program deviates from the humanitarian norm of 
	``uplift'' and absolute aesthetics---the bird's-eye view---and instead
	presents an understanding of music which resonates with ideas of 
	``listening with''---the view of the bird watcher, or in the words of
	Jenny Odell, the bird \textit{listener} who observes and is observed;
	who through acts of attention learns to perceive the world around them
	pluralisticly. In this section I argue that while \textit{Sesame
	Street} engages with aspects of critical pedagogy, it is ultimately 
	resistant to educational classifications. The program is itself
	\textit{ecological}, composed of many interacting and competing parts
	which create a program whose character is emergent and consistent, but
	not unified.   

	Part two is an analysis of classical music performance on the program, 
	framed through the analogy of the worm-listener---they who listen as 
	outsiders to 
	the arcane sound of the world beneath our feet. This section deals with
	questions of parody, virtuosity, and childhood. It contains three
	character studies of classical musicians who made appearances on the
	program: Yo-Yo Ma, Evelyn Glennie, and Lang Lang.   

	
	In this section I argue that \textit{Sesame Street} takes part in a
	long tradition of classical music parody which welcomes the outsider
	while at the same time engages the classical music native and initiate
	---that is, the worm, who has spent its life embedded in the classical
	strata.
	\textit{Sesame Street} neither challenges nor exalts the classical 
	music canon, but rather serves as an enabling technology, a 
	\textit{geophone}, which allows for the aerial listener to perceive and
	engage with the arcane sounds of underworld.  

	Here, I introduce Leonard Bernstein's dichotomy of education vs.
	pedagogy, that is, ``acquainting people with 
	new stuff they can come to love... rather than having to memorize the 
	conjugation of an irregular verb.''\autocite[71]{Kopfstein} I use this
	definition of education to contrast with the view of Classical music as 
	uplift and analyze how this dichotomy plays out on \textit{Sesame
	Street}.  

	This project takes shape in two media: one is what you are reading 
	right now, the 
	``white paper'' presentation of the research. The other is a 
	non-striated recreation of the field in the form of a Multi User 
	Domain, or MUD. The third section of this paper---the mushroom 
	hunter---deals with the themes of diversity,
	equity, and liberation which inform the project.  

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The majority of the case studies in this paper are presented as a long
	transcription of the skit. If the resources are available online, 
	there will also be the link to the recording in the accompanying 
	footnote. I do this with the philosophy of ``accessible design is good 
	design,'' that is, that everyone, not only the disabled, benefits from
	accessible technology and infrastructure. I leave these transcriptions,
	which were part of my analyses process, as assistive devices for those
	with visual or hearing impairments, or simply for those with bad
	internet connections, who would like to view the whole skit. Some might
	say that this is excessive and that I should just present what I need 
	in order to make my argument and move on. This may be stylistically 
	appropriate for 
	film studies, but I am a }\textit{\DIFdel{media ecologist}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. My ultimate goal is 
	not to make and defend arguments, but rather make space and fertile 
	ground for observation and analysis. I also follows in the 
	practice of ``thick description'' and observational ethnography 
	grounded in numerous specific and well documented observations.
	\ses, and television more generally, are no less cultural enactions
	than a rite or a pow-wow for being taped for television. They are
	expressions of culture dependent on the inculturation of the viewer 
	for the meaning, and deserve the same level of observation. They have 
	the benefit, however, of reproducibility. You do not have to be an 
	expert to read my ethnography and judge whether it is reasonable that
	an Azande woman would do this or that, you can simply watch the
	recording of Bert and Ernie, and decide if my reading and transcription
	aligns with your reading.

	dramatic monologue---written in first-person perspective
	which grounds the following discussion. If the chapters look at

	the geological bedrock on which these ecologies are based.

	\section*{Prologue: In \textit{media} res}

	\noindent
	On a summer evening in Saint Louis I was listening to the radio in
	the kitchen. In the research for this paper, which had grown from a 
	character
	study on Yo-Yo Ma to encompass the themes of eduction and public 
	broadcasting,
	I had decided that I should actually own some kind of broadcast 
	receiver. 
	After looking into mini televisions, I settled on the conservative 
	option
	of a radio. As I chopped onions, my local NPR station's weekend 
	programming
	buzzed in the background.

	A program on the recent events in Afghanistan had ended and the PSA 
	space, where a commercial station
	would have run adds, began. I heard a woman's voice say ``This is Saint
	Louis Public Radio. Understanding Starts Here.'' 

	My ears perked up. What an intriguing declaration. It is not ``This is 
	Saint Louis Public Radio, your source of news,'' or ``This is Saint 
	Louis Public Radio: hear the nation.'' Instead, the 
	slogan is a 
	promise to increase your \textit{understanding. }NPR is offering not
	just to 
	inform you, but moreover to provide some kind of ethical education,
	presumably into cultural-socio-political events such that one comes away
	\textit{understanding.}

	A strange word, ``understanding.'' In the context of the 
	socio-political,
	cultural and economic topics under the purview of national public 
	radio, something seems very kind about the word. It feels emotionally
	laden and steeped in empathy. 

	Its usage does not imply factual understanding, something like ``Let
	us factually explain what's going on in Afghanistan,'' but rather, 
	``cultivate an understanding of the human experiences of Afghanistan 
	along with us.'' 


	Etymologically, the ``under'' in the first half of the word 
	``understand'' does not denote the more modern ``below,'' but rather 
	among or in-between. \autocite{Ety} To understand is to stand among. 
	What NPR is offering, then, is empathy in a broadcast. 


	This offering of empathy continues the founding ethos of NPR 
	and its focus on hearing common people speak. 
	\textit{All Things Considered}, now one of the most listened-to programs
	on American radio, debuted with the chaotic coverage of
	what at the time was the biggest anti-Vietnam war protest to date. It
	consisted of tape gathered by multiple reporters at the event with no 
	overarching narrative. It was unlike anything on the radio at the time.
	Its chaos was intended to capture the chaos of the moment, but was also
	part of a larger aesthetic and political trend on the program to hear 
	the voices of normal Americans. Something now known as the 
	``public radio sound.'' 

	The sound is recognizable to this day by its lack of a 
	narrator and the featuring of interviewees from the general public. It 
	was pioneered by the ``founding mother'' of NPR, radio 
	journalist Susan Stamberg. She was inspired by the cinema verité of the
	time, saying that the idea ``was to tell a story without telling it---
	just sound through chunks.'' This meant no authoritative radio voice,
	but instead just giving everyday Americans time to talk before moving 
	along to another speaker. The work of narrative interpretation is left
	to the listener, who is given a more rhizomatic view of the events---
	a radical new direction in radio journalism and broadcast culture more
	generally.  

	One particular aspect of the public radio sound was the use of ``cross
	talk,'' a technique in which two voices are layered onto one another 	
	in polyphony, which was inspired by Glenn Gould's ``contrapuntal 
	storytelling'' in \textit{The Solitude Trilogy.}\autocite[197]{Porter}
	Stamberg retrospectively described the debut as having ``no interfering 
	narrator.''\autocite[185]{Porter}

	The showcasing of alternative voices was so central to the ethos of the
	young network that NPR turned down a \$300,000 donation from 
	the Ford 
	Foundation contingent on the network hiring well-known broadcast
	journalist Edward P. Morgan as host of \textit{All Things Considered}. 
	Morgan, recipient of a Peabody Award, would have certainly 
	brought the new network
	credibility, but NPR feared that the authoritative voice would
	get in the way of the alternative voices that they wanted to showcase.
	The ethos of ``standing among'' seems to be baked in to the entire
	project of public radio.

	This ethos is visible in public television as well. In the mid-1960s
	Ralph Lowell, Board Chairman of the Boston Educational Television 
	station proposed that the Oval Office put together a commission on 
	educational television. President Johnson, believing that this was
	a job for the private sector, turned to the Carnegie Corporation.
	What was formed was a diverse team known as the Carnegie Commission
	on Educational Television. Among others, this team included writer Ralph
	Ellison, concert pianist Rudolph Serkin, and labor leader Leonard 
	Woodcock.\autocite[409]{Meany}

	The commission put together a report titled \textit{Public Television, A 
	Program for Action} which stressed the artistic and transformative value
	of the medium and the importance of using it to resist the pressure 
	toward uniformity found in commercial television but instead seek out 
	and satisfy the needs of the nation's diversity.\autocite[410]{Meany}

	The need for this shift in broadcasting came about because the
	United States Government had granted access to the airwaves to 
	commercial stations
	first, only adding public stations to the media landscape as part of
	Great Society era reformations. Canada and England, on the other
	hand, created public broadcasting first and only later opened the
	airwaves to commercial stations.\autocite[412]{Meany}

	It was this same era of reform that lead the Carnegie Corporation
	in search of a way to increase the reach of their 
	humanitarian educational programs for inner-city preschoolers.
	\autocite[15]{Davis} Lloyd Morrisett, the vice president of programs at
	the Carnegie Corporation\autocite[7]{Cooney} and a psychologist
	\autocite[15]{Davis} had noticed his own daughter's fascination with
	the television medium when his three-year old got up early in the 
	morning to watch the pre-broadcast RCA test patterns.
	\autocite[11]{Davis}

	Morrisett then tasked Joan Ganz Cooney, a publicity specialist for the 
	\textit{United States Steel Hour}, a twice-monthly series on CBS, 
	\autocite[27]{Davis} with the project of producing a study
	on the educational possibilities of children's television, backed by a
	\$15,000 grant. The resulting report, \textit{The Potential Uses of 
	Television in Children's Education} analyzed the ways that the
	relatively new technology of television could be used as an educational
	supplement for preschoolers, particularly those from disadvantaged 
	backgrounds.

	It was this report which lead to the creation of the program at hand, 
	\textit{Sesame Street.}

	\section*{Entertainment: Welcome to \textit{Sesame Street}}

	\noindent\textit{Sesame Street} needs little introduction. One of the
	longest
	running shows in the history of television,\autocite{Brit} it has been a 
	cultural staple of generations of children---and their parents---in the 
	United States and worldwide.

	While \textit{Sesame Street} is an educational program, it is notable 
	for its entertainment value. This stems from the realization by the 
	original producers of the program that in order to compete with the 
	non-educational television competition only a turn of the dial away,
	televised preschool education would have to be just as 
	entertaining.\autocite[38]{Cooney} This is especially true given that
	at the program's premiere in 1969, there was nothing like it in the 
	children's media landscape.\autocite[See chapter 3 for a survey of the 
	contemporary children's television landscape]{Davis} This means that 
	there were truly no models for the production of the program, nor for 
	its
	reception---they could not trust that children knew how to watch
	educational programs.  

	This realization lead to a fundamental characteristic of the production
	structure of the program: rather than hire child development and 
	education specialists to produce the show, they used education research
	to inform decisions made by seasoned TV, radio, and Broadway producers,
	writers, composers, and actors. This decision was informed by the 
	observation
	that children respond well to adult television and were known to recite
	adds for beer and cigarettes, as well as having their attention held by
	adult variety shows such as \textit{Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.}
	\autocite[16]{Ostrofsky2012}

	But \textit{Sesame Street} is not just entertaining for children. 
	In order to encourage parents to watch the show along with their
	children, a move which would also help keep preschoolers focused,
	the producers aimed to make the show entertaining enough for parents
	to want to watch it along with their children.
	\autocite[294]{Ostrofsky2017}
	\footnote{Mixed-age television targeting likely began on the 
	television program \textit{Captain Kangaroo}. \autocite[46]{Davis}} 

	In terms of music, you see to this effect the featuring of musical 
	performers that parents would know, often playing educational parodies 
	of their own work. For example, Norah Jones' performance on \ses in 
	2004.\autocite{4081} Sitting at the piano with Elmo, Jones 
	re-spins ``I Don't Know Why,'' a somber song of heartbreak and 
	alcoholism, as ``I Don't Know Y,'' in which she laments all of the 
	words she can no longer spell, now that her friend, the letter Y, has 
	stood her up for a play date. Jones' performance and delivery are nearly
	identical to those which appear on her recording of the original for her
	album \textit{Come Away With Me.} This is ``quality'' music for adults
	which has been modified to fit the highly specific musical demonstration
	which is needed for the \ses educational project.


	\section*{Listening \textit{with}: Attention as Grounds for Ethics}	

	The ethos of music on \textit{Sesame Street} was perhaps best 
	summarized by Joe Rapso, the first music director of the program, in a
	1971 press release. The program's diverse music, he said, would
	help bridge cultural divides when the kids were grown up and ``bring all
	kids together, whether they live in Grosse Point or on 148th Street in 
	the Bronx... And the beauty of our music is maybe that the child in the
	Grosse Pointe home is hearing gospel and blues for the first time and 
	the black child in the urban ghetto is hearing a harpsichord and flute 
	for the first time. Someday, when they grow up, they'll have one more 
	thing in common.''\autocite[297]{Ostrofsky2012}

	Rapso's belief in the power of music is idealistic and his assumption
	that the privileged child has never heard blues or gospel is 
	over-simplistic, but we see with this statement a clear expression of
	an ethics of understanding through sonic exposure: 
	By using entertainment to focus attention and expose children to music 
	from other social and economic contexts,
	Rapso is promising not only a musical education, but also an ethical 
	one. Having ``one more thing in common'' is perhaps here grounds for 
	the social understanding which is historically valued by public media.  
	The ``power of music'' is an idea which often arises in neoliberal 
	discourses of music and its value. While Rapso's statement on the power
	of music to bridge cultural divides shares many of the same language
	as these neoliberal  discourses, I find that the presentation of music
	on \textit{Sesame Street} diverges from the standard neoliberal
	narratives of music and music education, which I discuss in the section
	``Grouchy about multiculturalism.'' I understand these neoliberal
	discourses through
	Ana Bull's analysis of their prevalence in the British musical
	education system in \textit{Class, Control, and Classical Music} and
	Marianna Ritchey's analysis of how classical music has been put to the
	service of capitalism in \textit{Composing Capital}. Whereas the musical
	narratives discussed in these books emphasize the creation of 
	value by the individual, the ethos of \ses, while it displays certain
	neoliberal aspects, leans strongly toward a more collectivist and 
	humanist ethos of understanding based not in creating value through
	music, nor even in creating music, but instead 
	based in sonic exposure and practices of listening.  

	I take many cues from sound studies and acoustic ecology, particularly 
	Annea Lockwood. A composer from New Zealand, Lockwood is known for her 
	fascination with the transitory nature of natural sounds, particularly 
	those of water and rivers. In the 1960s, Lockwood began a project with
	the goal of recording and archiving the sound of every river on the 
	planet.\autocite[117]{Rodgers} These recordings sometimes include the 
	sound of what she calls the ``river people,'' mixed in. These are the 	
	voices of the people who live and work on the 
	river.\autocite[121]{Rodgers} Though these interviews come from around 	
	the world and Lockwood has primarily been involved with anglophone 
	audiences, these interviews are never translated. Rather than strict 
	semantic meaning, Lockwood prefers to capture what she calls ``the 
	rhythm of memory,'' or the way that the speed and energy of an oral 
	recollection ebbs and flows as the speaker gropes for a shaky 
	memory.\autocite[122]{Rodgers}  

	In 2019 Lockwood selected the theme for World Listening Day, a global
	project by the World Listening Project, which celebrates acoustic 
	ecology and listening practices every July 18, the birthday of R. 
	Murray Shafer. The theme she selected was ``listening with,'' which she
	described as ``listening with an awareness that all around you are other
	life-forms simultaneously listening and sensing with you---plant roots,
	owls, cicadas, voles---mutually intertwined within the web of vibrations
	which animate and surround our planet.''\autocite{WLP}  

	She described in an interview how she came to this mode of listening:

	\begin{quote}
	\singlespacing

	``[I remember] in the little neighborhood of our house and around us 
	in the 
	woods---an alertness. There was a quality of an electric alertness in 
	the air and I suddenly realized I'm not the only one listening. I mean 
	everything around me is listening, you know.

	So instead of listening \textit{to} the neighborhood, I was listening 
	\textit{with} the neighborhood. And it's funny. It's a change of 
	perspective. It's as if I was used to having my ears swivel this way and
	I turned, simply turned, and now they're swiveling that way and the mode
	of hearing---the mode of absorbing, brings for me, a strong sense of 
	being totally interwoven with everything else 
	around.''\autocite{WLPVimeo} 

	\end{quote}
	\doublespacing

	Throughout this paper I use this phrase ``listening \textit{with}'' to
	describe situations and practices of listening and being which
	engage in this mutual sonic awareness. Along with its variation 
	``playing \textit{with},'' they form the two primary elements of my
	framework for the analysis of the acoustic ecology of 
	\textit{Sesame Street}. 

	To understand the practice of listening, I take the definition offered 
	by Pauline Oliveros, a contemporary and friend of 
	Lockwood.\autocite[116]{Rodgers} In relation to her practice of ``deep 
	listening,'' a complete and intense sonic awareness based in observation	
  rather than judgement, Oliveros distinguishes listening from hearing, 
	clarifying that ``to hear is the physical means that enables perception.
	To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically 
	and psychologically.''\autocite[33/366, As things stand today, e-books
	are basically useless for academic research because they lack, of all
	things, page numbers. At its bare-bones, a synthetic work like this
	methodology section is just a long list of page numbers, which makes 
	my reading habbits slightly unhealthy. I'm going to go back and find
	the page numbers in the hard cover edition, but for now, I will list
	them as fractions.]{Odell}  

	I take ``listening \textit{with}'' not as ``hearing \textit{with},'' 
	that is, not as co-perception, but rather an amorphous and rhizomatic
	form of co- and meta- awareness and offering of attention.  

	My understanding of attention and my larger framework for understanding
	the media ecology of children's television comes from the theories 
	developed by Jenny Odell in 
	\textit{How To Do Nothing}, a book at the intersection of media theory
	and ecology. Odell places attention as the center of ethics. We decide 
	who is seen, who is heard, and who has agency, through acts of 
	attention. \autocite[154]{Odell} I propose that Odell can help us 
	interpret the soundscape of \textit{Sesame Street} and the listening
	which it cultivates. I take her theories of attention as my primary
	framework for the ecologies of music and understanding
	prevalent in the program. I make this shift away from traditional
	musicological tools of analysis largely because \ses is a project which
	spans multiple generations of artists, producers, and sources of
	funding, yet has retained its character. It changes more like a forest
	does than a sonata. \ses is an emergent phenomenon, the result of the
	interactions and conflicts of numerous actors, rather than the vision
	of a small group of musicians and composers---the scale which current 
	musicological tools privilege. 

	Odell describes a way of engaging with the 
	world similar to that of bird watching, which she says is better 
	described as bird \textit{listening}.
	By listening with the birds---listening in a way which acknowledges
	ones own subjectivity and their location as another sounding element of
	the sonic world---the listener learns to differentiate and identify 
	the sounds 
	of the different birds in an environment, and thereby becomes aware
	of the ecology around them and their place within 
	it.\autocite[33/366]{Odell} 

	
	This ecological, attention-based understanding of the world requires 
	that one gives up the idea of discrete entities, simple origin stories,
	and simple one-to-one causalities, and above all, requires time.
	The direct product of this attention, Odell says, is context. 
	That is, paying close attention can help us better understand the 
	nuanced ecologies of being and identities that make up the ecological
	relationships of an environment. The longer that the attention is held, 
	the more context appears.\autocite[155]{Odell} 

	This is musically apparent in the skits of Muppet Simon Soundman.
	In one skit from 1973,\autocite{0458} Simon visits a music store, where
	he tells the shopkeeper
	that he is in the market for a ``nice, shiny---'' and then we hear a
	long trumpet lick as his mouth moves in time. 

	\begin{quote}

	``Uh... Oh... Would you mind repeating that, sir?''

	``No, indeed. What I said was I'd like to buy a nice, shiny---'' and
	then the trumpet sounds again. 

	The shopkeeper goes off-screen and returns with an instrument. 

	``Here you are, sir. A beautiful new violin.''

	``No, no, no... I don't want a---'' this time he makes violin
	sounds.  ``You see, because what I asked for was a nice, shiny---''

	\end{quote}

	And the skit goes on like this with for a number of minutes with the 
	shopkeeper bringing back the wrong instruments and Simon Soundman
	referring to them only through impeccable renditions of their sound. 

	This skit uses a simple and entertaining gag to expose children to the
	sounds, names, and appearances of several common instruments. Just as 
	Odell
	discusses leaning to identify birds by their sounds, children are	
	taught here to learn to identify the sounds of several common 
	instruments that you would find in the environment of music store or 
	a big band---the sound that the shopkeeper himself makes once Simon
	leaves, saying ``that fellow was pretty good. Huh. I should have asked
	him if he would like to play in our---'' and we hear the sounds of a
	big band.  

	But Rapso's statement on music and the broader ethos of \ses 
	demonstrated through its programming go beyond awareness and context of 
	musical instruments. It is primarily one of social context. To quote 
	pioneering broadcast journalist Edward R Murrow,
	the role of television is to make the world aware of
	itself.\autocite[49]{Davis} By creating a media platform through which 
	children of different backgrounds can gain exposure to each other's 
	music, they
	will have an increased awareness and understanding of each other.
	Implicit in all this is the idea that this will relive social and class
	tensions. The press release where this statement was made was titled 
	''Beetles and Beethoven, Move on Over. The Seventies Sound Is Sesame 
	Street.'' Rapso was selling the radical potential of the program and
	musical sounds, albeit idealistically. With this statement he was 
	selling a social and ethical education based in context and 
	understanding through acts of sonic attention. 

	This attitude, the social context of listening, is apparent in a number 
	of musical skits on the program.

	\subsubsection*{Case Study 1: Itzahk Perlman and ``What's Easy for You
	 is Hard for Me''}

	Fading in from black, there is a simple stage set with three folding 
	chairs. On the third to the right is an instrument case. Entering from 
	the bottom of the frame, a girl runs up the big grey steps to the stage 
	and takes a seat to the left, smiling. She looks in the direction she 
	came from. Itzhak Perlman enters with a cane in each hand. He begins 
	to climb the steps to the stage, swinging each stiff leg up to the next
	level and climbing one step at a time. 

	There are three big steps, presumably made from grey plywood, and then a
	small step up to the stage. By the second step, the girl begins to 
	fidget. By the third step her smile has faded and she looks to the side
	and kick her feet while she waits, perhaps to avoid staring.   

	Perlman climbs the small remaining distance between the steps and the 
	stage and turns to sit down. 

	``Ooff. Those steps,'' he says.

	In order to bend at the waist and hips to sit, he unlocks his leg 
	braces with an audible click and a rotation of his hips. He sits down 
	and pulls his hands out of the metal rings of his canes.

	``You know,'' he says, turning to the girl, ``some things that are 
	really easy for you are hard for me.''

	He picks up his violin and checks the tuning with two quick plucks with 
	his fingerboard hand and then a quick bow across each adjacent string
	pair, eyes closed. His tone is rich and bright, even when tuning. He 
	launches into an impressive flourish, starting with double stops 
	followed by a long run up and down the fingerboard, ending with a right
	hand pizzicato chord. He does this all with a certain light 
	effortlessness.

	``Yeah, but some things are easy for you that are hard for me,'' the 
	girl replies. She lifts her violin and plays a melody in a minor key.
	She 
	carries the tune, but her intonation is unstable. 

	Perlman tilts his head and leans in with appreciation as she plays.
	They both smile when she finishes.   

	\end{quote}

	The view of classical music which we gain access to here is not a
	traditional one. This is not a performance for an audience, but instead
	a intimate moment of discourse and vulnerability between two 
	musicians. Here, classical music is not seen from the birds eye view,
	that of 
	objective distance, looking over the musical landscape, but that of the 
	bird listener listening along with. There is no audience in this skit, 
	nor is there hierarchy, reverence, or authority. There is no criticism
	nor nor teaching going on and he is not there to fix or improve her
	playing. Perlman may be
	virtuosic, but he is not established as a master guiding his pupils.
	This skit is not about Perlman as an individual of status, but rather
	it is about the interaction of the two musicians and how they listen to 
	and acknowledge each other's lived experiences of music and the world. 

	We may be watching from home as a television audience, bit what we see
	is not the somber performance of canonic works, nor is it an accessible
	presentation of a classical music program for non-initiates. What we 
	are watching is a demonstration of ecological musical listening, of 
	listening \textit{with}. 

	One might object that this is \textit{media}, and that what we are
	seeing is fake, a construction. That is, in fact, the case. However, 
	that does not reduce the potential of an ecological reading of this 
	skit, nor its efficacy as a demonstration. What we are seeing here is a 
	representation of an empathetic and ecological experience and a 
	sandboxed recreation of real life, inasmuch as the producers created an
	actual experience on the set which we can view the recording of---an 
	experience which speaks to actual, lived, human encounters. 

	The word ``sandboxed'' comes from software design, where it is used
	to describe an isolated or contained area where a program can be run 
	with a limited number of resources, often so it cannot cause damage to
	or drain resources from the larger system. This term has been taken up
	by collaborative online communities and their projects, such as 
	Wikipedia, to describe webpages and other spaces where users are free 
	to experiment without risk of damaging actual 
	content.\autocite{Wiktionary} I use this term
	to describe a style of educational material where the learner is
	presented with a place to learn, play, and explore, much like a
	playground sandbox. The sandboxed space contains materials which are
	real and pre-existing, just as sand is, but have been curated for 
	educational purposes.

	And like sand on a playground is no less real for its context,
	this skit is no less real for being filmed. Perlman actually 
	limped up the tall steps onto the stage as he had done countless times 
	outside of the \textit{Sesame Street} set---this time was no easier than
	any other. The girl actually played as she has obviously done for
	hundreds of hours, and this time was no easier than any other. 
	Though what we at home are seeing is a representation of a social 
	encounter, it is a recreation of actual	experiences. 

	And its sandboxing does not detract from its meaningfulness, but rather,
	it is only through this sandboxing that it can be made into 
	entertainment and
	education such that it can contribute to an ethical education. 

	I say all of this to argue that an ecological reading and ecological 
	education 
	can come out of ``constructed'' media, that ultimately, it is not 
	un-reality which is created, but a guided slice of reality, made in 
	order to facilitate the ecological goal of awareness and context.  

	This next skit similarly features a disabled artist, deaf percussionist 
	Evelyn Glennie. However, while the Perlman skit called attention to
	ability and disability and modeled co-awareness and understanding, the
	following skit chooses not to address disability directly and instead 
	focuses on musical and social listening in the context of a classical 
	music performance. 

	\begin{quote}

	\subsubsection*{Case Study 2: Glennie and Linda}

	Glennie is first introduced by an off-screen voice: ``And Now, Evelyn 
	Glennie, world famous percussionist, will perform a duet with her 
	friend Linda.''

	Glennie walks in followed by Linda.  

	``Now, I'll tell \textit{you} when to come in. Okay," Glennie says, 
	signing and 
	speaking simultaneously, and hands Linda a single mallet.''  

	Glennie launches into an impressive piece of solo classical marimba for 
	four mallets. 

	At the beginning of an impressive run, Linda taps Glennie's shoulder.

	``Now?'' she signs and mouths.

	``Not now, not now,'' Glennie responds, lifting her mallets. She continues
	 with the run down from the high end of the Marimba to the middle. A 
	small hiccup at the end of the phase suggest that she is slightly 
	flustered, but only slightly. She continues on to the next phrase, 
	displacing Linda, who stands by her side watching closely, which each 
	step as she moves up and down the instrument. With a massive run upwards
	she finishes the phrase and raises her mallets into the air. Linda taps 
	her shoulder.

	``\textit{Now?}'' 

	``Not now,'' Glennie shakes her head. 

	Glennie crosses the stage to an assortment of unhitched percussion 
	instruments, including a snare drum and numerous cymbals and other 
	pieces of resonant metal. Glennie plays a very modern sounding solo, 
	impressive in its wash of timbres and coordination. At first Linda 
	plays close attention, but after a few moments she starts to look bored 
	and disappointed, crosses her arms, and lets her head droop.

	Glennie plays a roll on the snare and looks at her partner expectantly. 
	Linda is not listening. She tries again. The response is the same. 
	Glennie taps the splash cymbal lightly. She pokes Linda's shoulder. She 
	looks up.

	``Now!'' Glennie gestures at the cymbal with a large gesture. 

	Surprised, but excited, Linda raises her mallet and strikes the cymbal. 
	The audience breaks out in applause. The two look at each other with a 
	smile and shake hands. 

	They walk to the center stage and take a bow, first to the camera---
	representing the concert-hall audience---and then to each other. A girl 
	walks up to them and hands Linda, the amateur, a bouquet of flowers. 
	Glennie watches, miffed. She puts her hands on her hips and with a look 
	of shock and disappointment on her face. Linda, soaking up the applause, 
	smiles, and hands Glennie back her mallet, a gesture much like the lead 
	ballerina pulling a single rose out of her bouquet to hand to her 
	partner. Glennie takes the mallet, and storms off the stage, frowning. 
	Linda turns back to camera and smiles.   

	\end{quote}

	Whereas the first skit centered on ability and disability, this skit 
	does not present the two deaf performers as encountering any difficulty,
	not including interpersonal relationships. This is, in fact, where the
	humor of this skit comes from: their inability to listen to each other
	and their resultant misunderstanding of the meaning of a duet. There is
	a comic symmetry to their misunderstanding: Glennie is unfair to Linda, 
	during the performance, and Linda returns the favor at the end. 

	By focusing on this misunderstanding, deaf interaction is normalized,
	attention is drawn away from disability to the point that one might not
	even realize that the two performers are deaf---not in an erasure of 
	disability, but through the showcasing of Glennie's musical virtuosity,
	her domination of the stage, and the skit's focus on the friction
	which this creates between her and Linda.  

	This friction presents, as part of the musical lesson of the skit, 
	what a duet is \textit{not}, and in so doing suggests more fair ways
	that children might play with each other, musically or non-musically.
	This aspect of play is an enduring aspect of the musical performances
	on \textit{Sesame Street}, where adults often act in childlike ways.
	Analogs for children, Glennie and Linda show what can go wrong if we
	fail to listen---however it is in all of our human diversity that we
	do so. This skit presents an ethics of attention based not only in
	listening, but also in giving space for others to speak, make sound,
	and communicate. Through a comical demonstration of misunderstanding, 
	it delivers a lesson on how understanding starts from fair and balanced
	communication.	


	\section*{Education}	


	\textit{Sesame Street} was met with a broad range of reactions to its 
	educational model after its debut: 

	Echoing the thoughts of many traditional educators, preschool authority
	Carl Bereiter of the Ontario Institute for Studies in education wrote in
	the \textit{Wall Street Journal} the morning after the program's 
	premiere that the program was too far removed from ``structured'' 
	teaching and warned that the program could fail because ``it's based 
	entirely on audience appeal and is not really teaching anything in 
	particular.''\autocite[200]{Davis}

	It received an equal amount of criticism form progressive educators, 
	some of who thought that the program was too traditional. Frank 
	Garfunkle, a professor of education at Boston University wrote in the 
	alumni magazine that ``any claim that \textit{Sesame Street} is a major 
	educational or media innovation is preposterous. The values implicit in
	the form and content--strictly three Rs with a mixed bag of dressing---	
	are traditional... The image of \textit{Sesame Street} as a unique 
	vanguard of educational experience is a mirage.''\autocite[201]{Davis}

	When the program was later slotted to be shipped abroad in 
	international co-productions, the BBC turned it down. Children's 
	program chief, Monica Sims, described the program ``authoritarian'' 
	referring to its aims to change children's behavior and its emphasis on 
	right answers.\autocite[211]{Davis} This last observation is at odds
	with the intentions stated by Joan Ganz Cooney in her inaugural
	research for the program: almost all of the experts she interviewed 
	wanted to see the teaching of cognitive habits---as defined by Jerome 
	Kagan to be analysis, generating hypotheses, and reflection---rather 
	than trying to teach them skills such as how to read. The idea was to
	teach how to think, not what to think.\autocite[23]{Cooney} 

	That there were such varied responses to the educational model of the
	program speaks to its complexity and its resistance to educational 
	labels, traditional or radical.   

	On the face of it, \textit{Sesame Street} quite literally conforms to 
	the broadcast model of education. The whole project is, after all, 
	inherently instructivist: it was created as a response to the question
	``how can we use new technology to give preschool education to as many 
	children as possible?'' The program 
	uni-directionally streams educational material to the learner watching 
	and listening at home, who is left to absorb the information. The 
	learner has no say in constructing their own education. When it comes to
	the educational material it presents on basic literacy and numeracy 
	there are, as noted by the BBC, clear right and wrong answers. 
	Furthermore, the program has a curriculum 
	designed by education researchers with intended outcomes and takeaways 
	for each lesson.\autocite[117]{Davis} 

	Literacy and numeracy education are, however, only part of the 
	educational project of \textit{Sesame Street}. A great deal of the 
	programming can be interpreted as, and has been expressed by its 
	creators, as giving kids a cultural and emotional 
	education.\autocite[297]{Ostrofsky2012}
	A majority of this cultural and emotional education is open ended. 
	In the skit with Itzahk Perlman, viewers are exposed to the stunning 
	playing of a professional, the attainable playing of a child, 
	disability, ability, and co-mutual visibility. When the two musicians 
	play for one another, they do so to express their mutual relationship, 
	not simply so that the other may listen. They are both listening and 
	playing \textit{with}. 

	What is a child at home supposed to get from this? This is where 
	\textit{Sesame Street} may be simultaneously instructivist and 
	broadcast-based, but 
	is moreover \textit{non-striated.} I use this term 
	\textit{non-striated} to denote a space which is not
	hierarchical and bounded like striated space as understood by Deleuze 
	and Guatari, but does not fall into the ``nomadic'' and free spaces 
	which they describe as ``smooth.'' 

	The \textit{listening with} aspect of its 
	educational model drops the learner into an existing network of 
	understanding, discourse, and culture, such that what they take away
	from the lesson depends on their personal proclivities and needs, 
	whether that is simply hearing the master violinist play, or the 
	understanding that some thing that is easy for one person can be hard 
	for others. The combination of the educational goals of the experts
	in Cooney's report and the musical ethos of Rapso, we get a program 
	where children are taught how to \textit{listen} as a cognitive habit. 

	I use this term \textit{non-striated} to denote a space which is not
	hierarchical and bounded like striated space as understood by Deleuze 
	and Guattari. In a chapter of their book \textit{A Thousand Plateaus: 
	Capitalism and Schizophrenia} titled ``[The year] 1400'' the duo 
	establishes a binary between smooth and striated spaces. This chapter, 
	or rather, this
	plateau, might be described as a strophic prose poem where the concept 
	is introduced several times, each time through a different lens. The 
	binary 
	is rated to fabric versus felt,	agrarian versus nomadic societies, and 
	distances versus magnitudes, to name a few.   

	To the best of my knowledge, the pair never uses the term 
	``non-striated,'' but they state that no space is only smooth or 
	only striated, but must be an ever-changing mixture of the two as one 
	gives rise to the other.\autocite[474]{Deleuze} Given that they also 
	recommend that you read their book the way that you would listen to a 
	record,\autocite[ix]{Deleuze} I interpolate out from this binary the 
	gradation of the ``non-striated'' which does not necessarily 
	imply smooth amorphism, but moreover a lack of the ruled, bound, 
	measured, and governed spaces of fabric, the state, and---in this 
	case---the traditional classroom.       

	The educational analyses in this paper are informed in large part by 
	Ivan Illich and his book \textit{Deschooling Society} where he argues
	that learning would be improved by the abolition of formalized
	compulsory education. Along these lines, Illich says that it is 
	delusional to think that we can determine what is necessary education 
	for others and what is not.\autocite[12]{Illich} Furthermore, Illich 
	demonstrates the ways that the traditional classroom asserts itself as
	the only worthwhile source of education, which Illich argues actually 
	limits the number of skilled and educated people\autocite[39]{Illich} 

	\textit{Sesame Street}, on the other hand, understands that it is not 
	the only source of education, nor does it attempt to be. In this way its
	educational material can be much more open ended and nuanced. 

	In one of Yo-Yo Ma's appearances on the program in the 1980s' he plays
	a classical quartet with the Muppets. Bob the music teacher appears, 
	but he does not lead any lesson. In fact, he is pushed off the stage by 
	a conducting Big Bird who tells him to take a seat after Bob hints that
	he finds the whole affair silly.

	Where is the schooling, where is the teacher, in this skit? The 
	traditional teacher is physically forced off the stage, leaving no clear
	instructor.  Perhaps the teacher is the program itself.  While the 
	producers have presumably decided what should be taken away from this 
	lesson---have in a sense decided what should be learned---there is no 
	direction or guidance into how it should be watched. Ivan Illich
	proposes that in the place of traditional educators we have
	pedagogical counselors who would advise a student on where to seek 
	instruction, what methods of learning would be appropriate for their 
	skills, and the like. A role more like that of a subject librarian or a 
	museum curator combined with a personal tutor.\autocite[43]{Illich}

	The presentation of classical music in this skit falls more in line with
	this style of focused curatorship; The producers of \textit{Sesame 
	Street} present to children a number of performances deemed appropriate
	for their age and level of understanding, but do not coerce their view 
	or their understanding in one direction or another.


	Of course, this is a written out, synthetic performance. It's not 
	footage of Ma playing at Carnegie Hall, but something written with the 
	express purpose of educating and entertaining children. While children 
	are free to make their own judgements on the performance and learn from
	it on their own, it is sandboxed. It is a slice of worldly music---Yo-Yo
	Ma---fictionalized into an entertaining and open-ended skit. 

	Illich argues that ``childhood'' as a period of life separate from 
	infancy, adolescence, or youth did not begin to appear until the 
	Renaissance, and not in its present form until industrialization.
	\autocite[13]{Illich} He continues that childhood is not only a modern
	invention, but is also a burden to the adolescent, who is prevented 
	from being whole person.\autocite[14]{Illich}

	One might argue, then, that a true Ilichian education would disavow the
	entire idea of children's' media and simply present children with 
	performances of worldy art---perhaps in this case simply with 
	\textit{The Muppet Show}. This idea holds less water when you 
	acknowledge that, again, the role of the Ilichian counselor is to curate
	materials appropriate to the skills and understanding of the learner, 
	not just to throw them into the deep end of, say, molecular biology 
	and tell them to swim. Anarchist education entails the lack of coercion,
	not the lack of guidance. 

	Furthermore, the argument that it is non-Illichian because it is
	is children's media depends on the assumption that \ses is educational
	material only and not itself a work of art. 
	Analyzing \ses as art opens a whole tool set for understanding as well
	as bringing us closer to the production experiences of the Broadway, TV,
	and radio producers who were writing the show.  

	Illich also argues that obligatory schooling divides society into the 
	realms of the ``academic'' and the ''non-academic'' and thereby renders
	education non-worldly and the world non-educational.\autocite[12]
	{Illich} On \textit{Sesame Street}, the musical education is more wordly
	than it is ``educational,'' giving children a more or less direct look 
	into the world of popular music. Even the show's set, based on actual
	streets and buildings in Harlem\autocite[154]{Davis} has a
	 woldly character to it where children learn \textit{casually}---by 
	which I mean, even when they are not being taught a lesson in spelling,
	they are being exposed to themes of difference and coexistance, not to 
	mention exposure to kinds of music which they may not have heard 
	and to the people who make them. In this way, the world is rendered 
	educational. Likewise, 
	education is rendered wordly as, for example, B.B. King singing about 
	words that start with B. This is a lesson in literacy presented through
	music which is very much ``of the world'' and has its own real racial, 
	social, and historical discourses which are rendered in its very 
	vibrations. This is not ``childrens music'' or music built from scratch
	particularly to teach children words that start with B, but rather a 
	worldly art form adapted for this particular lesson-context.

	I say all of this not to make the hard-line argument that \textit{Sesame
	Street} is virtuous and non-traditional, but rather that is  
	resistant to educational classifications.
	It is somehow at once instructivist, yet open-ended. This
	is what I mean when I say that \textit{Sesame Street} is non-striated: 
	It is not a reproduction of the traditional classroom where students are
	coerced into learning what their teachers deem important, but instead 
	learners are free to interpret the skits to find whatever emotional or 
	cultural meaning that they themselves need. Neither is it a smooth 
	and amorphous Deleuzeian space with no educational goals or structure, 
	but 
	instead a sandboxed, curated space of open-ended cultural and 
	emotional learning.

	This all makes sense given that the program was developed in order to 
	help close the gap between underprivelideged and middle class 
	preschoolers\autocite[sec. 1]{Cooney}. These are learners who, 
	definitionally, have not yet been schooled. Therefore all of their 
	learning so far has been casual and incidental. Illich addresses this 
	exact problem when he argues in the introduction to \textit{Deschooling
	Society}, that poor students will always be behind their wealthier
	counterparts\autocite[5]{Illich}. Poor students lack the books, 
	conversations, and travel which casually educate wealthier children.
	A non-striated, Illichian education, then makes perfect sense for
	a televised early-childhood supplement.

	\section*{Funding, political backgrounds, and deschooling society}

	Perfect sense, except for the fact that it was funded by the nation’s 
	two largest philanthropic organizations—the Carnegie Corporation and 
	the Ford Foundation—and the United States Government. Critic John 
	Leonard spoke to this conflict directly with his comment in the New 
	York Times that ``Any project seducing the philanthropies of two private
	foundations and a government agency is suspect.``
	With this statement he was questioning the ability of the program to be
	a truly socially liberal institution, stating that ``Government agencies
	are permitted to exist... only so long as they use hair sprays to 
	attack our various social Medusas.'' \autocite[146]{Davis} Leonard 
	points to a central conflict in this study of Sesame Street: how radical
	is it really? How radical can it really be, given its establishment 
	patronage?

	As a partial answer to this question, I would say that the program ended
	up being more radical than its proposal suggested. This was in no small 
	part due to executive producer Joan Ganz Cooney’s trust of her artists 
	and 
	the resulting hands-off approach to leadership.\autocite[155]{Davis} For
	example, a distinctive feature of \ses is is its urban set:

	Jon Stone, who wrote, produced, directed, and acted on the program knew
	from the start that he wanted a set which moved as far away from the 	
	conventions of children's television as possible.  
	Inspiration struck in the winter of 1968 when a PSA by the New York 
	Urban Coalition aired on television. The PSA, which opened with the
	printed message ``send your kid to a ghetto this summer''  was a biting
	satire in the style of a travelogue which pointed out the lack of 
	amenities for urban children. Seeing this, Stone realized that the show
	must have an inner-city set. For urban children, the sets of traditional
	television---enchanted castles, circuses, toymakers workshops---were
	utterly foreign spaces. But ``for a preschool child
	in Harlem,'' he later commented, ``the street is where the action is. As
	often as not she is housebound all day while her mother works, and, from	the vantage point of her apartment, the sidewalk outside must look like
	Utopia. Outside there are kids hollering, jumping double Dutch, running
	through the open hydrants, playing stickball. Our set had to be an 
	inner-city street, and more particularly it had to be a brownstone so 
	that the cast and kids could `stoop' in the age-old New York tradition,
	sitting on the front steps and watching the world go by.'' The set was 
	modeled after the actual streets and buildings of Harlem by set designer
	Charles Rosen. In particular, Stone wanted a movie style set, in all its
	detail, not the cardboard and canvas used on children's television at 
	the time.\autocite[154]{Davis}

	Cooney, known for her hands-off approach to leadership is remembered by
	Stone as responding to this idea by saying ``something to the effect 
	that we were the people she chose to create this program, and if this is
	how I saw it, so be it.'' \autocite[155]{Davis} 

	This idea of an urban set, and the racial politics which that 
	entailed, came after the funding was secured. In effect, what the 
	funding agencies of the Children’s Television Workshop were signing off
	on was Cooney’s proposal to use television entertainment as an 
	educational medium for preschoolers. Given the state of the children’s 
	media landscape at the time \autocite[chapters 1, 3, and 4]{Davis} this 
	was no conservative proposal, but perhaps its radicality was seen more 
	as technological than social---at this point the ideas as they were 
	presented did not include the racial politics which we will see in 
	the Hoots and Ma skit in section X, but were more involved with 
	questions of the ability of the technology---so far used only for 
	mindless entertainment---to educate. This education was intended 
	especially for inner-city children as part of the humanitarian goals 
	which undergird the project, however, throughout its conception and 
	production, the Children's Television Workshop tried to make a program 
	that would appeal equally to children of all classes. In short, the 
	program which received funding in 1967 was perhaps not what aired in 
	1969.

	Of course, to receive continued funding, they must have satisfied their 
	patrons and not offended their sensibilities. This may have been made 
	possible by the fact that the Children's Television Workshop  was
	running all of their lessons and skits through scientific trials with 
	children and they aired what worked. Follow-up research was regularly 
	conducted to make sure that kids were learning ``in 
	vivo''\autocite[118]{Davis} and perhaps	this was enough.

	This answer is a bit hand wavy, and \ses did eventually lose government
	funding: In 1972 the Children's Television Workshop launched a plan to 
	phase out federal funding by 1981, as the Nixon administration was 
	opposed to the entire principle of public television and wanted to end 
	the production of new episodes of \ses and its sister program
	\textit{The Electric Company.}\autocite[218]{Davis} 

	There is another 
	way, however, of looking at the problem of funding and leftist politics.
	So far the question has been ``if \ses was so 
	radical, how did it get funded by such high-profile institutions?'' But
	where did the assumption arise that these are incompatible? It comes 
	down to pragmatics: In order to keep up with the non-educational 
	television competition which was only the turn of a dial away, televised
	preschool education would have to be just as 
	entertaining.\autocite[38]{Cooney} This is just showbiz. What do you get
	when you turn Broadway writers into distance-learning educators? You get
	anarchist education, not because of socio-political ideologies, but 
	simply because it is a solution to the problems of the format. Watching 
	with parents is encouraged, but ultimately it must be entertaining 
	enough that no proctor is required to keep the child focused on the 
	program, and in preschool distance education there is no possibility for
	coercion: Other techniques of attention must be found. For a number of 
	reasons, almost all of the experts interviewed by Cooney wanted to see 
	the teaching of cognitive habits, as defined by Jerome Kagan as 
	analysis, generating hypotheses, and reflection, rather than trying to 
	teach them skills such as how to read. She writes 
	``in the opinion of most, a television program would be very useful 
	which would teach young children how to think, not what to 
	think.''\autocite[23]{Cooney} This is non-striation par excellence: the
	student is not guided down a 
	predetermined path, but instead encouraged to cultivate certain 
	attributes which will help them see their own path through whatever 
	situations they may experience.

	Going forward, when my analysis refers to aspects of \ses as 
	``ecological,'' ``deschooled,'' or ``anarchist,'' these are not to imply
	that executive producer Joan Ganz Cooney was an anarchist media theorist
	who 
	constructed a program based on her philosophies of education, but rather 	
  that the answers to the particular design problems which the writing 
	team faced led them to a particular philosophy of design which, by way 	
	of a sort of convergent evolution, lies so close the above philosophies 
	that Ivan Illich provides a functional language for the analysis of 
	\textit{Sesame Street}.

	Taking as my definition of anarchism, ``the principled opposition to 
	coercion,'' what we have here is instead ``the pragmatic disutility of 
	coercion.'' Is this anarchism? In many ways no, but the results 
	are so similar that it is hard to tell the difference, or if that 
	difference is really meaningful.

	My analysis via these philosophies does the work of highlighting this 
	convergence with radical politics which might otherwise go unnoticed. 
	``Anarchy'' is a word which frightens both those on the left, seemingly
	 resonant of Libertarianism, and those on the right, for whom it stinks 
	of Marxism. My goal is multifold: on the one side I would like to 
	analyze these aspects of \textit{Sesame Street}’s musical education 
	which have gone overlooked. This is germane to scholars of 
	\textit{Sesame Street}, television, and children’s media. On the other 
	side, this is relevant musical pedagogy more broadly. In a sense,
 	I am attempting to radicalize \ses and thereby normalize anarchism and 
	deschooling and in so doing suggest new forms of education for all ages. 
	I am writing this at a time when arts education in public schools and 
	humanities education in higher ed are being challenged by both the 
	weight of late-stage capitalism and the destructive influence of a 
	global pandemic. What can be found in the \ses archive which 
	reveals its emergent philosophies of education, and what do these 
	design 	practices reflect about musical education more broadly? 
	In other words, how can \ses give us insight into more resilient forms
	of musical eduction?

	This is not, mind you, a paper on how deschooling can save education and
 	how \ses gives us a convenient case study to this end. Illich 
	describes education as the fundamental state of human kind, it needs
	saving no more than does the abstract concept of love. I would also 
	like to distance myself from the number of popular narratives which 
	place the university in a moment of crisis. For one, crisis denotes 
	a singular moment wherein a watershed decision must be made. Working 
	within the Illichian framework, the moment of crisis came and went in 
	the early modern period and maybe earlier.

	Rather, this section has been a critical look into the emergent design 
	philosophies of musical distance-education as they appear in the \ses 
	archive. While my research is localized to one particular television 
	program, this study has ramifications for the present moment of 
	education. That said, my goal is not to suggest that instructors remove 
	their attendance requirements and stop assigning letter grades, but 
	rather, in an Odellian sense, to teach the bird-song of non-coercion 
	so that it may be appreciated where it perches.

	\section*{Prologue: Geophones, televisons, worms}

	I spent something like a quarter of my life on the south side of 
	Chicago. There was a summer during that period where I got into the 
	habit of biking down to the 63rd street beach to comb the sandy shore 
	for pebbles. There were two kinds that interested me: shiny black 
	pieces of anthracite coal, and pale grey honeycombs of steel slag. Some
	thirty miles down the coast, at what now is the Indiana Dunes National 
	Park, the beach is littered with pebbles of all kinds, glittering 
	happily beneath the surf or ice of the ancient lake. Here, however, in 
	the scorched earth left behind by the bonfire that built and destroyed 
	America, the pebbles were largely fossils of that recent past.

	That summer I went on a sound walk organized by the Midwest Society of
	Acoustic Ecology at the former site of the US Steel foundry. A section 
	of the massive industrial campus had been re-wilded and returned to its
	pre-steel state of fresh-water marsh. Some birds chirped, we saw an 
	egret, but it had turned out to be one of those hot summer days where 
	the air is still, heavy, and all the more stifling for its enveloping 
	silence. 

	At some point the walk took us to a part of the wooded hammock where 
	the artists had driven microphones---geophones---into the earth. When 
	my turn came around I put on the headphones and listened. 

	I was immediately made aware of my on weight on the ground beneath me. 
	Any small motion and I would hear myself in the microphone like an 
	earthquake. Any large motion and the bugs, which I now realized were all
	around me, would stop and I would have to wait for some time before they
	started to move again. 

	I had never heard anything like it. It was a sound impossible to 
	describe in terms of our air-based hearing. And I was part of it. The 
	subterranean bugs heard and responded to me just as I to them. Through 
	the assistive technology of contact microphones and digital amplifiers, 
	I was given access to the worm's-ear view of the ever-present world 
	beneath my feet. The sounds were foreign, but in no way unpleasant. Is 
	this the sound of an ant, a worm? I don't know, but I like it. For me as
	an air-based listener, this was the sonic experience of a complete 
	outsider.	

		
	\section*{The \textit{Young People's Concerts}: classical music and 
	mass media}

	\noindent The Bernstein \textit{Young Peoples Concerts} are perhaps the
	best known example of public classical music pedagogy. Leonard 
	Bernstein's tenure
	on the program spanned 14 years from 1958 to 1972. The program, televised by
	CBS, was intended to expose adolescents to classical music by meeting 
	them where they were in terms of musical understanding. This included  
	explaining concepts in classical music through references to popular 
	culture.    

	This program marks a different way of doing classical 
	music
	pedagogy. Bernstein was critical of the traditional modes of music 
	appreciation, which he described as falling either into the categories 
	of anecdotes and nothing about music, or analysis. He saw the first as 
	coy and
	the second as dull. Instead, across his pedagogy, he chose to focus on 
	the mystery of meaning in music. He breaks musical meaning into four 
	categories: narrative-literary meanings, atmospheric-pictorial meanings,
	affective-reactive meanings (like triumph or melancholy), and purely 
	musical meanings.\autocite[14]{Kopfstein}  His pedagogical intention 
	was ``to create and recreate a communally engaged 
	audience''\autocite[51]{Kopfstein} and his goal is reflected in this
	turn toward this framework which is engaged and analytical, yet 
	qualitative and accessible.  

	In a letter to Humphrey Burton, Leonard Bernstein wrote that 

	\begin{quote}
	''The great
	benefit [of television], for me, is the educational value, not only in 
	the pedagogical sense but in the best sense of acquainting people with 
	new stuff they can come to love (which is what I mean by education, 
	rather than having to memorize the conjugation of an irregular verb.) 
	Bringing music close to people... has always been my lifelong desire and
	goal even in writing my music. And I think there is nothing that comes 
	near to television for this purpose. This is the best communicative 
	means, and, after all, communication is what television is 
	about.''\autocite[71]{Kopfstein}
	\end{quote}

	Bernstien makes a distinction here between ``pedagogy'' and 
	''education,'' suggesting that education is something more humanistic 
	and having to do with pleasure and appreciation, rather than learning 
	for simply pragmatic reasons. Bernsteinian education, which television 
	enables, is about exposing people to new things that they can come to 
	love. Education and classical music are not, importantly, about 
	that oft cited ideal, \textit{uplift.} 

	In her book \textit{Class, Control, and Classical Music} Anna Bull 
	analyzes the socio-cultural meanings of classical music in British
	society. She argues that the practices of classical music contribute to
	the formation of a middle-class selfhood as middle class people use the
	cultural capital of the music and its institutions to maintain class
	boundaries through the accrument of ''cultural capital''---a word which
	refers to any form of value that can be acquired through classical music 
	practices.\autocite[4]{Bull}\autocite[3]{Bull}

	Bull analyzes how the ethos of long-term dedicated practice which is 
	seen in classical music means that those who are unwilling or unable to
	invest the time and resources required are unable to participate.
	This, combined with the ideal of ``autonomous'' art which 
	positions classical music outside of social, political, and economic 
	concerns, creates a well disguised boundary which preserves middle 
	class spaces.\autocite[6]{Bull} To this point, it is put rather frankly
	 by Claire Hall that ability in classical music can be 
	understood from a Bourdieusian perspective as simply the investment by 
	the musician's parent's and teachers in middle-class 
	ideals.\autocite[7]{Bull}

	The idea of classical music providing economic and spiritual uplift from
	poverty is perhaps most recently and famously demonstrated in 
	Venezuela's El Sistema and the propagation of numerous El Sistema 
	inspired organizations.  In essence, these organizations stipulate that
	if you get impoverished children to act like middle-class children they
	will be better off and find both economic and moral uplift.  

	Bernstein's pedagogy does not interact with class in the same ways. 
	The ethos of the \textit{Young People's Concerts} is, as seen in the
	letter above, one of ``education'' not ``pedagogy.'' 
	The goal is not to provide uplift for
	underprivileged youth, but instead to acquaint them with new music.   

	However, it is not completely without its class boundaries.
	Though Bernstein is quoted by
	his student Alicia Kopfstein-Penk as making no distinction between
	highbrow and lowbrow, saying that ``there is only 
	`brow,'\,''\autocite[xvi]{Kopfstein}  he did engage in pedagogy which
	appreciated the lowbrow through the highbrow: Bernstein worked to
	convince people to appreciate the ``lowbrow'' music of jazz, folk, and
	pop by relating them to ``highbrow'' classical 
	music.\autocite[63]{Kopfstein} As much as this does to ``elevate''
	these other musics, which have been overlooked by white and monied 
	society, using western classical music as a metric re-inscribes its
	superiority and ideals of universality.  
	David Hesmondhalgh argues that we should look at the ways that
	music reinforces structures of power, rather then reinforcing old 
	narratives about the power of music.\autocite[xiii]{Kopfstein} 
	In this case, although Bernstein is expanding the discourse of the power
	of music to these lesser-appreciated art forms, he is inadvertently using
	music to reinforce the power of the classical music institutional 
	ecology---that is, the framework of organizations that make up the 
	classical music world.\autocite[27]{Bull}  

	I read this in large part as a symptom of how inescapable class is in 
	classical music. No matter the engagement, even if it is accessible 
	pedagogy and education via electronic mass media, the power of the 
	classical music
	establishment and its institutional ecologies are re-inscribed. As
	we will see in section II, even parodies of classical music 
	uphold its status as much as they deride it. By 
	setting up the elite musical culture as an object worthy of deflation,
	its status and spectacle are preserved in their high 
	place.\autocite[252]{Garrett} In a sense, the middle-class parents 
	studied by Bull have the world that they want: there will always be
	an inside and an outside to classical music. There will always be the
	worm and the worm listener: those who listen from the inside and those
	who listen from
	the outside. This difference, however, does not have to look like
	class-warfare. Though the \textit{Young People's Concerts} engage in 
	classical metrics, the education is kind, welcoming, and 
	based in exposure and entertainment, not uplift. After all, most viewers
	of the televised concerts were adults---only 6\% were the
	target audience of the ``typical 13-year old.''\autocite[2]{Kopfstein}    
	This demonstrates a co-permeability of worm-listening across the
	earth-air barrier. It is media enjoyable and educational across the
	spectrum of classical music familiarity. The \textit{geophone} that is
	television allows for aerial ears to listen to the underground, and the
	worms hears the aerial listeners listening,    

	\section*{Mass media}

	So far, I have looked at \ses as a piece of 
	children's educational media. At this point, I would like to take 
	a step back and look at the program as a piece of art---as a piece of
	popular art. Frankfurt school Marxists and cultural theorists Theodore 
	Adorno and Max Horkheimer famously problematized popular art and mass 
	media under late stage capitalism in a chapter of their book 
	\textit{Dialectic of Enlightenment} titled ``The culture industry: 
	Enlightenment as mass deception.''\autocite{Adorno} Late capitalism'' 
	or ``late stage capitalism'' 
	refers to an economy in the trajectory of capitalism where the 
	concentration of capital has already taken place and the problem 
	becomes finding new consumers such that supply does not exceed demand. 
	In this stage of capitalism, advertising takes on new importance, as
	the economy depends on manufacturing new consumers as well as new 
	goods.\autocite[66]{Baugh}
	Where the worker was alienated from their labor in earlier stages of 
	capitalism, they are now additionally
	alienated from their needs, drives, and imagination.\autocite[66]{Baugh}
	During this period, Adorno argues, popular art masks this alienation 
	by providing diversion and pleasure which provide psychological shelter
	from the truth of alienation and so pacifies the
	masses.\autocite[67]{Baugh}

	According to Adorno, emancipatory art, unlike papular art and media, 
	would bring about the painful experience of being aware of one's own 
	alienation. Emancipatory art reawakens the feelings of dissatisfaction 
	and unease, the results of late capitalism, which have been occluded by
	the entertainment industry, popular art, and advertising. Emancipatory 
	art makes possible the recovery of this ``experience of the negative.''
	This accomplishment, however requires that the artwork be difficult to 
	understand according to normal modes of thought. This difficulty reveals
	to the listener the inadequacy of normal modes of thinking, which opens 
	the mind to new ways of thinking as it reveals the old ways to be 
	lacking. However, because this opening of the mind is revelatory of 
	formerly illusory perception, it leads to anxiety rather than elation. 
	Ultimately, this realization can lead one to try to change their 
	relation to the world by changing the world 
	itself.\autocite[67--69]{Baugh}    
	This negation of consciousness wrought by emancipatory art can be 
	achieved, he argues, not through the direct negation of standard 
	artistic practices, which may come across as banally contrarian, but 
	rather through sheer inscrutability and the creation of an uncanny 
	sensation where the meaning and reason for the creation of the work are
	not immediately attainable.\autocite[71]{Baugh}

	Bruce Baugh, problematizes this line of reasoning, pointing out, rather
	simply, that the arcane nature of Adorno's ``difficult'' art necessarily
	requires a certain amount of training to understand and create. This 
	training requires time outside of productive labor, thus implying a 
	class distinction in which some are required to work while others are 
	able to live off the labour of workers and follow intellectual pursuits
	instead. Adorno's emancipatory art is damned from the start because it 
	requires a bourgeois class. \autocite[74]{Baugh} It is in a sense, 
	trickle down emancipation. Baugh argues instead that emancipatory art 
	can arise from,
	and is in fact best created by, mass culture itself. He argues that this
	was seen with the art and music of the 1960s.\autocite[77]{Baugh}

	Both authors put stock in the power of ``emancipatory'' art to expand 
	the consciousness. I find emancipatory art in this context to be a 
	misguided concept deeply rooted in classism and ideas of classical music
	as uplift. While Baugh may argue against the classist aspects of Adorno's
	characterizations of emancipatory art, he only reinforces ideas of music 
	as uplift and as having the ability to expand class consciousness.
	For these reasons, I do not 
	find the idea of art as either emancipatory or pacifying a useful
	category for analysis, though this is not at all to say that children
	are not alienated. 

	Children in the United States are not generally part of the labor force 
	and so are not engaged in productive labor. This would seem to 
	disqualify them from capitalist alienation. However, children are in a 
	constant state of labor at school, where they receive an education 
	designed to prepare them for their entry into the labor force. With no 
	control or ownership of their education, these students are at an 
	ultimate level of alienation, especially given, as Paulo Freire says, 
	it is only through inquiry that we make ourselves human: Knowledge 
	emerges only through invention and reinvention through inquiry. Apart 
	from inquiry individuals cannot be human---it is through engagement 
	with the world that our humanity manifests.\autocite[72]{Freire}  
  	Children are also susceptible to the same kinds of advertising and 
	manufacturing of the consumer which define late stage capitalism.  
	A child may very well be just as alienated as their parents.  

	While I think that emancipatory art is a misguided ideal, I find value 
	in the idea that art can cultivate in the viewer new ways of observing
	and sensing the world and that this is seen in, and was the ultimate
	goal of, Bernstein's public pedagogy as well as the musical education 
	on \textit{Sesame Street}. It doesn't have to be difficult, 
	but it helps to be unfamiliar.

	\section*{Listening \textit{with} the Music: Ecological Humor} 

	Victor Borge was a Danish pianist of Jewish heritage. He was known for 
	parodying the names of composers and unexpectedly inserting moving 
	performances of the classics into what were otherwise comedy 
	routines. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \autocite[255]{Garrett}

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{During his career in the United

 \DIFaddend 

	Making fun \textit{with} the music resonates with Lockwood's 
	``listening with.'' What Lockwood means by this is that in any 
	environment you are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not listening to , say, the birds , but rather 
	listening

	 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{some of }\DIFdelend the direct 
	subject-object relationships of ``listening to,'' favoring a more

	\textit{with}, rather than \textit{of} the music, he is, like Lockwood, 
	dismantling subject-object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relationships---in this case they would be 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationships---instead of }\DIFaddend the performer and

	objectivity of the musical and comedic act are not, in a sense, 
	\textit{focused} on the work of art as funny object, but on the 
	relationship as the source of humor. That is, Borge is not making of 
	Mozart himself when he parodies his name, nor is he really deriding the
 	classical music establishment, for as Garrett argues, classical music 
	parodies uphold the status quo\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
}\DIFaddend 

	Parodies of classical music such as those in the Marx Brothers's *A 
	Night at the Opera* or the animated short film \textit{What's Opera, 
	Doc?} uphold the status of classical music as much as they deride it. By
	setting up the elite musical culture as an object worthy of deflation, 
	its status and spectacle are preserved in their high 
	place.\autocite[252]{Garrett} The representations of classical music in
	\textit{A Night at the Opera} simultaneously ``punches up'' to classical
	music, mocking its elitism, while it bridged the divide between high and
	low culture. While this was entertaining to those outside of the 
	classical world, it offered nuanced entertainment to those with a 
	knowledge and admiration of opera.\autocite[251]{Garrett} 

	Borge said that it was generally the case that those who laughed
	the most at his performances were those who were more musically 
	educated. In order to be successful, all parody and satire require that
	the audience has a certain level of cultural 
	knowledge.\autocite[249]{Garrett} However, he stressed, he was always 
	working two audiences at the same time---those knowledgable of classical
	music and those who are not. He said ``my jokes must be understood by 
	everybody. Nobody must be bored.''\autocite[256]{Garrett} 

 	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Borges }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Borge }\DIFaddend is engaged in a refocussing of the subject-object 
	relationship to one which is more reciprocal and circular. The entire 
	audience, who he was adamant about not leaving behind comedically, are
	in a sense gathered around the piano, having fun with Mozart, but not at
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{his expense. What Borge described as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Mozart's expense. Part of the humor is accomplished by making himself
	the object of ridicule and self depreciation, as he clowns around the
	musical object, playing multiple pianos, falling off the piano bench,
	and reads music in strange and unusual ways. In a sense, he plays an
	}\textit{\DIFadd{anti-virtuoso}}\DIFadd{, who is highly skilled, but has little sense. 
	In one performance, he keeps overshooting his octave leaps and missing
	the right edge of the piano, so he gets up and moves the whole piano
	over a foot to compensate. 
}

	\DIFadd{Borge uses the music not as the object of the humor, but instead
	showcases the music while he uses it as a structure
	around which a comedy routine is built. 
	This is what what Borge called }\DIFaddend ``making fun with the music\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.'' It }\DIFaddend is a 
	restructuring
	of subject object relationships akin that that of Lockwood's ``listening
	with.'' He is not looking at the music, pointing at it, and laughing at
	its expense, rather he is engaging with it, listening to it, and 
	constructing something new in collaboration with it. In general parody 
	tends to highlight certain qualities and virtues of the music, even if 
	it makes fun of others. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Borge thought that this attitude had brought
	new listeners to classical music, who would go back to the concert hall 
	for more music without the comedy.}\autocite[256]{Garrett} \DIFadd{As with 
	Bernstein, we see the use of something accessible---humor,
	pedagogy---as a gateway into classical music.
}\DIFaddend 

	A similar style of ``making fun with the music'' as undertaken by 
	Borge can be seen on \textit{Sesame Street}. Some of the exact same 
	devices are used, such as the parodying of the names of classical 
	composers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, but more significantly, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and physical clowning. More significantly, however, }\DIFaddend there is 
	a shared sense of using
	parody to uphold the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aesthetic and cultural }\DIFaddend status of the music \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) and the ways that this shifts
	subject-object relationships and allows for listening /textit}%DIFDELCMD < {%%%
\DIFdel{with }%DIFDELCMD < } %%%
\DIFdel{the music}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{while
	changing the subject-object relationships around and within it. 
	These shifts allow for listening }\textit{\DIFadd{with}} \DIFadd{the music. This is one
	of the prevalent forms
	of classical virtuosity expressed on the program: }\textit{\DIFadd{virtuosity as 
	listening with}}\DIFadd{, expressed through the cultivation of co-mutual
	listening. Of course, the showrunners are not trying to
	get children into concert halls in the way that Borge and the
	classical establishment which supported him were with an adult 
	audience, but the educational mission of \ses
	is benefits from this style of entertainment and the shift in 
	relationships which it brings about. Similar to, but different from the
	gateways of
	accessibility created by Bernstein and Borge, on \ses, humor creates 
	space for }\textit{\DIFadd{engagement}} \DIFadd{with music which is otherwise culturally
	considered exclusive and esoteric. Play creates a momentary world 
	where the rules of classical music are different and one can play 
	at a concert hall with improvised instruments, unheard-of composers,
	and strange musical collaborators. This is the geophone of the
	}\textit{\DIFadd{worm listener}}\DIFadd{. Play allows one to enter, listen to, and be 
	listened to by the musical underworld of classical music which is so 
	often out of limits}\DIFaddend .

	\section*{``\textit{Pretty Great} Performances:'' \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{play, parody, and 
	}\DIFaddend classical music \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parody }\DIFdelend on \ses}

	Recall the particular design constraints of music on children's
	television faced by the writers of \textit{Sesame Street}: 	
	They wanted to expose children to new ``serious'' \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{music without }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{music---that is, music
	made for adults rather than children---without }\DIFaddend boring
	them, but also without boring their parents, who they hoped would be 
	watching along\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with them}\DIFdelend . In the words of Victor Borge ``nobody must
	be bored.'' One solution to this problem of two audiences is parody,
	for example the aforementioned performance by Norah Jones, where she
	parodies her own work. A related technique was used during virtuoso 
	flautist James Galway's appearance on the show in 1989. Not lyrical 
	parody, but rather a parodic pastiche, Galway performs with the ``All 
	Animal Chamber Music Ensemble'' at ``Barn-egie'' hall. As part of the 
	``Pretty Great Performances'' concert series---a parody of the New York
	Philharmonic's ``Great Performances'' series---host ``Phil Harmonic'' 
	introduces Galway and the ``works of the great composer, Johan Sebastian
	Fox.'' \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this performance, }\DIFdelend Galway delivers an impressive flute 
	performance to the accompaniment of a chamber ensemble of animal 
	puppets, all quacking and barking along in strict 
	counterpoint.\autocite{Galway2}

        While the Jones and Galway performances are obviously very different, 
	they both take the form of a juxtaposition of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{serious music and 
	performances with
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``serious'' music and 
	performances---that is music primarily for and by adults, often with
	implications of listening behaviour such as dressing up and listening 
	attentively---with }\DIFaddend contexts or lyrical contents which are inappropriate 
	for the genera.\footnote{See also, Ostrofsky,  ``\textit{Sesame Street}
	as a Musical Comedy-Variety Show,'' 18.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Or}\DIFaddend , alternatively, silly music
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is presented }\DIFaddend in serious contexts such as the concert hall. This 
	virtuosic whimsy 
	works because it showcases skilled performances and exposes children to
	music which is perceived as having quality, while being varied enough 
	to hold their attention, all the while being amusing to any parents who 
	are present. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This not only exposes children to music, but moreover fills
	the basic goals of the program by providing a place where 
	social-emotional skills can be modeled through the structure of
	classical music. Akin to Borge's use of classical music as structural
	center and aesthetic object around which to center comedy, \ses 
	uses classical music in the same way, in order to provide a place for
	the modeling of social-emotional skills. Recall Evelyn Glennie's 
	onstage conflict with Linda---a lesson in how }\textit{\DIFadd{not}} \DIFadd{to listen
	and a satire of unfair play. 
}\DIFaddend 

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In general, this virtuosic whimsy is far }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is an example of an enduring aspect of musical guest performances
	on }\textit{\DIFadd{Sesame Street}} \DIFadd{and its presentation of virtuosity: adults 
	pretending to be children pretending
	to be adults. In order to model adult activities and culture through the
	emotional lens of children, adult stars act like children who are 
	dressing up and acting like adult performers, rather than like their
	normal adult persona. This adult-child hybrid 
	presents aspects of both childhood and adulthood: The performers are 
	competent and skilled, yet vulnerable, curious, and sometimes immature.  
	``Childhood'' as a period of life separate from infancy, adolescence, 
	or youth did not begin to appear as an idea until the Renaissance, and
	not in its present form until industrialization.}\autocite[13]{Illich}
	\DIFadd{These stars point to and perform childhood as instead a fundamental 
	aspect of human nature: everyone has some child-ness in them and some
	more than others. While it is more present it youths, it is as unfair
	to say that adolescence is characterized by childhood as it is to say
	that old age is characterized by chronic pain. Rather than encouraging
	kids to grow up and act like adults, virtuosic whimsy places real value
	in certain aspects of childlike behavior.
}

	\DIFadd{In general, virtuosic whimsy---the combination of highly cultivated
	skill with contexts and actions which are comically at odds with the
	seriousness that is expected for performers at this skill level--- is 
	}\DIFaddend more pronounced in performances	of classical music than popular music.
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is likely just because classical music is itself associated more
	with an aesthetics of solemn ritual than any other music. It as a point
	around which parody can easily be made, especially for children whose
	primary cultural understanding of classical music is that it is 
	``serious'', ``fancy'', and 
	exclusive. In order to shed this image of classical music, it is often 
	expressed and parodied as }\textit{\DIFadd{play}}\DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend In another appearance on 
	``Pretty Great Performances,'' a tuxedoed Galway performs a duet for 
	flute and pool toy.\autocite{Galway1} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Compare this to Norah Jones's performance 
	where she parodies her lyrics, but her piano and voice are backed by her
	normal jazz combo. While much of the music on }\textit{\DIFdel{Sesame Street}} 
	%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{expresses virtuosic whimsy, classical music in particular is expressed 
	as }\textit{\DIFdel{play}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. In the Galway performance, his }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{His }\DIFaddend duet partner, Sesame 
	Street inhabitant Maria Figueroa,\autocite{Maria} plays a literal toy. 
	Part of this skit, ostensibly, is simply to demonstrate to children that
	air is needed to play the flute just as it is needed to fill a swim 
	tube. However, it seems significant that the pool toy is played by Maria
	the Puerto Rican repair-shop worker and not any of the many musicians 
	who live on Sesame Street. The writers of this skit are leveling 
	classical music as something attainable and fun----attainable to a 
	working-class woman of color---rather than serious, somber, and 
	esoteric. Like Galway, Maria is clothed in concert dress and taking part
	in the pomp and circumstance, however, what they are doing is not 
	ritual, but play. Virtuosic whimsy allows for classical music to retain 
	its cultural status, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but shed its 
	exclusivity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{practices, and aura, but crack open its 
	exclusivity: the pomp and circumstance, serious atmosphere, 
	and the expectations of time devoted to the cultivation of instrumental
	skill---which are all ultimately a stand-in for 
	class---}\autocite[7]{Bull} \DIFadd{become themselves a thing of play, 
	deconstructed and sandboxed}\DIFaddend . 

	\section*{Authenticity}

	An appearance by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Yo-yo }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Yo-Yo }\DIFaddend Ma on the program reveals the unusual status 
	which ``authenticity'' has on \textit{Sesame Street}. In a similar 
	skit to that of Galway at ``Barn-egie Hall,'' Ma plays the 
	``Beethoven quartet for two honkers, dinger, and cello,'' 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Written notby ``Ludwig Van }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

	\begin{quote}

	\DIFadd{The scene opens with the honkers---Muppets with bulbous noses and
	trumpet-shaped horns on their head---slapping their faces and honking 
	while a dinger---a Muppet with a bell on its head---stands between them.
	Big bird, dressed as a conductor shakes his head as they honk. Bob the
	music teacher enters stage right 
}

	\DIFadd{``Hi Big Bird.''
}

	\DIFadd{``Oh, hi Bob.''
}

	\DIFadd{``What's uhh, what's going on?'' he asks with a shrug, hands in pockets.
}

	\DIFadd{``They are getting ready to perform a quartet.''
}

	\DIFadd{``A honker and dinger quartet? Sounds interesting, Big Bird'' Bob 
	chuckles.
}

	\DIFadd{``Hmmm... You think it's silly, huh? Well, let me tell you Bob, they 
	just rehearsed and they sounded }\textit{\DIFadd{beautiful}}\DIFadd{!''
}

	\DIFadd{``Well, beautiful or not, Big Bird, it can't be a quartet because a 
	quartet needs four musicians, and I only see one, two, three.'' The 
	camera cuts to the honkers and dingers who count themself as Bob counts.
}

	\DIFadd{``Ahh, but number four is coming---right now. So if you just take your 
	seat''---Big bird pushes Bob out of the frame and off the stage---I will
	introduce him."
}

	\DIFadd{Turning to the audience, Big Bird announces: ``The Sesame Street Chamber
	Music Society is proud to present our very special guest: Yo-Yo Ma!''
}

	\DIFadd{With applause, Ma enters stage left in a tuxedo with cello in hand, and
	turns to the audience ``We will perform for you, the Beethoven quartet 
	for two honkers, dinger, and cello.'' 
}

	\DIFadd{The camera cuts to a close up of Bob, who puts his hand on his chin and 	wonders aloud ``He wrote that, Ludwig van }\DIFaddend Beethoven, the famous 
	composer\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,'' but }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{?''
}

	\DIFadd{``No,'' Ma replies, }\DIFaddend ``Murray Beethoven, the famous honker\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.''
}%DIFDELCMD < \autocite{MaHonkers} %%%
\DIFdel{In this performance, 
	Ma demonstrates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{!''
}

	\DIFadd{Motioning toward the green honker to his left, the Muppet bows to great 
	applause.
}

	\DIFadd{Ma turns towards the three other performers, who gather near each other
	in preparation. Murray Beethoven raises his chin to count them all off, 
	Ma replies with the same gesture, and they begin to play with a clean 
	downbeat. Ma plays melodic material on the cello, demonstrating 
	}\DIFaddend impressive technical ability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend playing double stops and fast 
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{melodies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{passages }\DIFaddend high on the fingerboard. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Accompanying this display of 
	skill are three puppets, two ``honkers '' who each have a pair of cranial
	protrusions shaped like bicycle horns which honk when they press on 
	their nose, and 
	one ``dinger'' with a bell on its head. What they are 
	playing sounds very common practice era, and is an effective pastiche. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The honkers and dinger have three
	notes between them and provide counterpoint and accompaniment in a tight
	coordination. During the performance, Ma orients himself toward the 
	other players. Although he looks away from them to consult his music, 
	which is only half in the shot, he leans towards them as he plays, and 
	spends about half the performance turned toward them making direct 
	eye-contact. The dingers and honkers themselves are oriented 
	semi-circularly in the way that singers often do.
}\DIFaddend 

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{What we see in both }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{They finish with a triumphant sonority and the audience applauses. Ma 
	rises to shake the dinger's and honker's hands.}\autocite{MaHonkers} 

	\end{quote}

	\DIFadd{This performance demonstrates a playing and listening which is highly 
	conversational. We can see this a foil to lesson on how not to listen 
	provided by Evelyn Glennie. Here, everyone takes their turn without a 
	fuss, and communicate constantly through non-verbal cues, which render 
	their intense listening highly legible. In terms of whimsical
	virtuosity, we see Yo-Yo Ma performing with conviction and commitment 
	something which Bob, who is often rather musically conservative compared
	to the Muppets, sees as silly. Both }\DIFaddend the Ma and Galway performances 
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is a certain 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{display a }\DIFaddend whimsical virtuosity, where players \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may be highly skilled , but are not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are highly skilled and 
	engaged in the performance, but do not take part in the }\DIFaddend somber and 
	serious \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{performance aesthetics common to classical music. This manifests
	both through their individual performances and the situational humor of
	toy instruments and puppet collaborators. 
}

	\DIFaddend This particular blend of virtuosity and situational
	humor brings into the mix questions of authenticity: In playing the
	music of ``Murray Beethoven, the famous honker,'' Ma is represented as a
	serious and skillful interpreter of music, but not as a voice from the 
	past. The classical canon seems less canonic on \textit{Sesame Street}.

	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Authenticity is a tricky subject.
        }\DIFaddend In her article ``Staging Authenticity'' Karen Leistra-Jones conceives of
	19th century authenticity as a performative category, not a stable 
	category which some musicians had and some 
	lacked.\autocite[400]{Jones2013} In other words, authenticity is 
	something which artists performed, just as they performed interiority. 
	Adding to this appraisal, authenticity seems to me something which is 
	created in the audience and not in the performer. Artists may cultivate
	authenticity---Leistra-Jones says that musicians performed authenticity
	and cultivated it in their personas---however, I want to stress that 
	authenticity does not exist in isolation. Authenticity is something 
	ascribed to the musician by the audience. The performer can suggest 
	authenticity, but ultimately their status as ``authentic'' falls on the 
	listener. I see ``authenticity'' as a socio-cultural artifact---
	something like a superstition---and if authenticity does not exist, how 
	can a performer ``be authentic?'' All that a performer can do is take 
	up the cultural signifiers of authenticity and present them back to the 
	audience.

        When this audience is composed of young children, however, the 
	listenership has little conception of what constitutes classical 
	authenticity. On \textit{Sesame Street,} the idea of authenticity to the
	classical canon is destabilized. In performing a piece by ``Murray 
	Beethoven, the famous honker,'' Ma's image as an interpreter of a 
	venerable canon is redirected. Whoever composed this piece is more or 
	less meaningless to the skit's young audience. Most children at this age
	would not \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be }\DIFaddend interested in or privy to the classical canon which 
	Beethoven 
	represents, so the voice from the past---the authenticity of which is 
	created in the locus of the audience---simply does not exist. Nor does 
	\textit{Sesame Street} try to teach \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this canon }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the classical canon from this 
	valence}\DIFaddend . The emphasis here is on 
	classical music as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{something funand approachable, not steeped in 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as set of practices which are fun, approachable, and 	based in attentive and co-mutual listening. While classical music on 
	\ses means
	dressing up in traditional garb and putting on a performance in a 
	concert hall, it includes toys for instruments and is steeped in 
	exploratory play, rather than }\DIFaddend tradition and arcane cultural memory. 
	Authenticity and composers' 
	intentions are not emphasized on \textit{Sesame Street} because these 
	are things which are as much the work of the audience as they are the 
	cultivation of the performer. Virtuosic characteristics 
	are attainable on \textit{Sesame Street}, but historical and 
	compositional authenticity are essentially impossible given the 
	audience's youthful lack of education on the topic. 

	\section*{Virtuosity}

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Sesame Street }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{Sesame Street}} \DIFaddend does not present a homogeneous image of 
	virtuosity. This 
	is likely due to their diverse set of guest stars. Even between 
	different skits featuring the same artist we see them play different 
	generas and cut different images of virtuosity.

	In the presentation of classical virtuosity on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ses}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{Sesame Street}}\DIFaddend ,
	we see a number
	of regularly used techniques: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{radical cosmopolitanism}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multi-traditionalism}\DIFaddend , childlike 
	playfulness and vulnerability, and general approachability. These 
	techniques establish classical music as something other than the stodgy 
	music of plaster busts and starched collars. Bob the music teacher and 
	his establishment ideas are often in tension with the desires of the 
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{classical performers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{actual celebrity classical musicians }\DIFaddend who appear on the program\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this way, \ses 
	dissolves the exclusivity of classical music and presents it instead as
	something fun and accessible. \ses does not just showing kids ``what 
	quality is,'' but perhaps more importantly, demonstrates that a music's
	association with class is not a marker of inaccessibility}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
	To this effect, classical musicians on \ses demonstrate their 
	virtuosity by }\textit{\DIFadd{not playing}} \DIFadd{classical music}\DIFaddend . Sesame
	Street looks a lot like a musical Utopia, where all kinds can play 
	together without the boundaries of class, race, ethnicity, or 
	species---the limits of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this kind of Utopia }\DIFaddend are discussed in the next 
	section of this paper. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To this effect, classical musicians on \ses demonstrate their 
	virtuosity by }\textit{\DIFdel{not playing}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{classical music 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Regarding classical music and performers,
	however, as a part of the program's educational goals of exposure-based
	music appreciation as well as the social-emotional lessons embedded 
	in the forms of listening which it teaches, the program uses the 
	virtuosic performances of classical musicians to deconstruct the
	cultural contexts and boundaries that are maintained around classical
	music and reconstruct the genera and its performance practices as a 
	form of play akin to any other. This is a ``punching up'' akin to that 
	of that Marx bothers in which parody challenges the social status of
	the music---in the honkers performance, the idea that classical music
	is somber and serious---while maintaining an appreciation for its 
	aesthetics. The piece performed by Ma and the Muppets sounds like
	classical music---delightfully so---and places value on the aesthetics 
	of the common practice era. However, its situational humor of virtuosic
	whimsy and its concomitant positioning of classical music as play
	rather than as serious work, practice, and ancestor worship suggests 
	that we can have the aesthetics of classical music 
	without the exclusivity and class boundaries---without the hours of 
	violin lessons and investment in middle-class identity---that are 
	inherent in its rituals}\DIFaddend . 

	\subsection*{Character Study 1: Yo-Yo Ma \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and Virtuosity as 
	Listening With}\DIFaddend } 

	Yo-Yo Ma's individual persona interacts with \textit{Sesame Street}'s
	educational project to create a diverse presentation of virtuosity. 
	Between his five appearances on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{program }\DIFaddend in the 1980s he is shown as 
	playing with incredible technical skill and concentration, as 
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{culturally }\DIFaddend omnivorous, and lastly, using the technique of virtuosic 
	whimsy, Ma 
	takes part in the leveling of classical music. This says a number of 
	things about Ma and his virtuosity: that it knows no stylistic bounds,
	that it is internalized, and that though he is virtuosic, he \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is 
	human
	}\DIFaddend and his art \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are human and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend approachable. All of these are attained via the ways
	that he is shown listening, whether that is listening 
	cross-culturally, in an ensemble, or whimsically.  

	In one \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of Yo-Yo Ma's appearanceson Sesame Street}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{appearances}\DIFaddend , now posted on the 
	\ses YouTube channel as ``Sesame Street: Yo Yo Ma: The Jam Session,'' 
	Ma is absorbed in practicing a somber melody in an alley on one of 
	\textit{Sesame Street}'s urban sets.

	\begin{quote}	
	Hoots, the saxophone playing owl, whose accent, vocabulary, and general
	composure suggest an alignment with African American \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{culture}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{identity}\DIFaddend , leans out
	of the window of a walk-up, saxophone in hand, and asks Ma if his cello
	can ``play anything a little more---upbeat?'' Ma rises to the challenge,
	replying to Hoots that his ``cello can do anything your saxophone can 
	play.''

	Hoots takes up the friendly gauntlet and begins to play a number of 
	soulful phrases on his saxophone, each more complex than the last, to 
	which Ma responds with a near exact copy down to phrasing and tremolo. 
	After three volleys, Hoot concedes the duel, turning to the camera and 
	saying ``Man. That is one mellow, cello''---fun wordplay, but also an 
	acknowledgment that Ma has \textit{soul}.

	\end{quote}

	While Ma is now known for genera-crossing performances, when the first
	of his \textit{Sesame Street} appearances aired in April \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of
	}\DIFaddend 1986\autocite{2210} Ma was just beginning to play outside of the 
	classical cannon, releasing his first cross-over albums, 
	\textit{Bolling – Suite for Cello and Jazz Piano Trio} and 
	\textit{Japanese Melodies}, both in 1984.\autocite{MaSite} We can read 
	this performance by Ma on \textit{Sesame Street} as an early expression
	of his now-famed versatility. The cross-culturalism for which Ma is 
	known is not just about the aesthetic appreciation of diverse music, but
	is part of a cultural-political project of seeking trans-national 
	empathy and alliance building. This is sought both through the supposed 
	universality of classical music, as seen in Ma's globe-trotting 
	``Bach Project''\autocite{BachProject} and through celebrations of the 
	diversity yet compatibility of the world's musical cultures as seen in 
	Ma's Silk Road Project. This second attitude is expressed by a musician 
	in the trailer for \textit{The Music of Strangers}, a 2016 documentary 
	about the Silk Road Project, when he says ``We don't speak perfect 
	English or perfect Chinese or perfect Persian, but we speak perfect 
	music language.''\autocite{Strangers} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ma's collaborator treads the
	well-worn fantasy of music as a universal language, but here framed as

	On \textit{Sesame Street}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend early intimations of this project of 
	universality are apparent in Ma's performance with Hoots. Ma's ability 
	to crossover and play jazz and blues showcases a world where folks of 
	all kinds can play together. In this skit, Ma demonstrates a technical 
	mastery of the instrument and
	aural skills. He does this not through traditional classical 
	performance,
	but though the vessel of cultural omnivory. His virtuosity is 
	established not just as a classical soloist, as the opening of the skit
	suggests, but as someone who can play anything, and everything equally 
	masterfully. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Not to mention gamely. Ma eagerly crosses imagined musical
	and cultural divides, smiling all the while. He models a willingness to
	make friends with just about anyone through the power of listening and 
	play.
}\DIFaddend 

	But moreover than omnivorous playing, what \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{you see }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is showcased }\DIFaddend here is an 
	intense
	act of listening---virtuosicly so. Ma's presentation of omnivory is 
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{slightly, yet importantly, }\DIFaddend different on \ses than it is in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the outside world}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{his general
	public persona}\DIFaddend . Rather than focusing
	on genera fusion or on the universality of certain canons, here, Ma 
	demonstrates virtuosic and universal listening by playing 
	along \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extemporaneously }\DIFaddend with music that is outside of his traditional 
	purview as a 
	cellist. Hoots displays listening through his responses, verbal and 
	musical. This is listening across boundaries. Ma is Asian and a human 
	being, and Hoots is African American and an owl. What is demonstrated 
	in this performance is cross species, cross cultural, and cross racial 
	listening. Musical kinship is established between these two characters 
	who come from different worlds. They are able to listen to each other, 
	challenge each other, play together, and find commonality, while 
	maintaining what makes them unique and highlighting their differences. 
	\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend Through this exercise in musical play and co-mututal listening, the two
	musicians go from standing apart, as they play in different generas, 
	reflecting different class and social worlds, to standing together: to 
	\textit{understanding}.

	This is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{virtuosity as }\textit{\DIFdel{listening with}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{not just Ma's performance here as a cross-cultural collaborator,
	but a enduring aspect of his public persona. In his public appearances,
	Ma almost always presents a kind and affable personality. His virtuosity
	is framed though an interpersonal and cultural kindness and curiosity. 
	He is presenting }\textit{\DIFadd{virtuosity as listening with}}\DIFadd{, expressed
	through }\DIFaddend the
	cultivation of co-mutual listening\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
	}\DIFaddend Visual artist David Hockney\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, known for his paintings and his 
	multi-valent photo collages }\DIFaddend said, comparing \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{his painting 
	}\DIFaddend \textit{Yorkshire 
	Landscapes} to television that ``if you show the world better, it's more
	beautiful, a lot more beautiful. The process of looking is the 
	beauty.''\autocite[100]{Odell} Likewise, here, the \textit{listening} is
	the beauty, is the virtuosity.  


	\subsection*{Race and genera}

	From his vocabulary, vocal delivery, and occupation as a jazz 
	saxophonist, it is clear Hoots the owl is Black. Hoots is voiced by 
	African American puppeteer Kevin Clash, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{who is also the voice of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the first black puppeteer on the
	program, who also gave voice to }\DIFaddend Elmo. 
	Clash designed Hoots's gravely voice after that of Louis 
	Armstrong.\autocites()(Also see the biographical documentary of the same
	name.)[41]{Clash} The question of what is going on in this skit racially
	is complex\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Ute Kraidy has written about race and multiculturalism on }\textit{\DIFdel{Sesame Street}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{in the article ``Sunny Days on 
	}\textit{\DIFdel{Sesame Street}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{? Multiculturalism and Resistance Postmodernism. ''
	In this paper }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as it is on the program in general. The diverse cast of 
	monster and humanoid Muppets as well as humans of all races and 
	abilities models the diversity of an American city. \ses scholar Ute 
	}\DIFaddend Kraidy argues that in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the way, in }\DIFaddend addition to teaching skills related
	to basic literacy and counting, \textit{Sesame Street} provides children
	with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cultural context}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the cultural context to navigate the world as informed citizens}\DIFaddend .
	\autocite[13]{Kraidy} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It does this though a
	highly
	diverse cast of humans and monsters and by addressing their differences
	while highlighting their likeness}%DIFDELCMD < \autocite[18]{Kraidy}%%%
\DIFdel{.  
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{On the program, difference is addressed while
	likeness is highlighted}\autocite[18]{Kraidy}\DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend \footnote{In 
	1992, \textit{The Economist} criticised this aspect of the program, 
	calling it ``hyper-tolerance'' which leads to ``an intolerance of those
	who do not practice this hyper-tolerance.'' See Kraidy, 14.} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In a
	touching performance by Elmo and Whoopi Goldberg, they
	compare their skin, hair, and fur. As Elmo learns the differences 
	between their bodies, Whoopi points out that her brown skin and his 
	red fur may be different, but are both beautiful and worth being proud 
	of.}\autocite{2746} \DIFadd{This is both a message of Black is Beautiful, as
	the program draws attention to and celebrates Black hair and skin, and 
	a more universal message of body positivity. Difference on \ses models
	the diverse environment of American cities, teaches body positivity, 
	and exposes children to other cultural ways of living and being.
	}\DIFaddend 

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The ethos behind the idea that exposing children to a diverse spread 
	of adult would lead to children from different backgrounds growing up
	to have ``one more thing in common,'' as expressed by Joe Rapso, is not
	limited to the program's musical education. When the producers of 
	\ses approached Cree artist and activist Buffy Sainte-Marie about
	appearing on as a musical guest, she was such a fan of the show's 
	educational 
	model that she suggested that she instead assist in developing a 
	curriculum on modern-day Native Amerian culture, which she did from 
	1975 to 1981.}\autocite[235]{Davis} \DIFadd{In her appearances, she teaches 
	about native American music and ways of life. She breastfed her 
	child Cody on the program in what was the first ever broadcast of 
	breastfeeding on American television. }\textit{\DIFadd{Sesame Street}}\DIFadd{'s 
	educational goals are as rooted in giving children a place to learn
	about the diversity of the world as they are in basic literacy
	and numeracy. The cultural curriculum tends to look more like exposure
	through candid conversations between characters than formal
	lessons.  
}

	\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend highlighting of similarity through \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{difference }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{acknowledgement of difference 
	via conversation }\DIFaddend is apparent in Ma's 
	performance with Hoots. In \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this skit we see an Asian Ma play music with 
	an aurally 
	African American owl. In }\DIFaddend popular American culture, ``soul,'' 
	``swing,'' and ``groove'' are somatic experiences and expressions of 
	phrasing and micro-timing which are especially present in African 
	American musical styles. Because of their identification with the music
	of Black America---and likely due to a cultural disrespect for Black 
	musical labor---the ability to play with these categories of expression
	is often attributed to racial makeup. Obviously, however, these are 
	performance practices which are and can be learned. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < 	%%%
\DIFdel{In this skit we see a visually Asian Ma play music with an aurally 
	African American owl. }\DIFdelend On the other side 
	of the spectrum from the 
	cultural myth that Black Americans play music naturally with feeling is
	the idea that Asians and Asian Americans are dedicated practicers who 
	play with great technical skill but little feeling or emotion. Mina Yang
	addresses this cultural phenomenon in her book \textit{Planet Beethoven}
	where she \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{write }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{writes }\DIFaddend that ``This critical trope casts Asians in a binary 
	opposition vis-à-vis Westerners: Asians have the technique, Westerners 
	have the heart, the soul. The image of Asians as automatons, robots 
	without souls, appears frequently in the Western imagination, standing 
	in as an effigy conjured up by the Western resentment of Asia’s growing
	prosperity.''\autocite[79]{Yang} This skit begins by highlighting the 
	cultural divide between the Asian Ma and the Black Hoots by pitting 
	their two preferred musical styles against one another. However, using 
	the technique of highlighting similarity though difference, whatever 
	dissimilarities exist between Ma and Hoots in terms of musical talent or
	inclination are rendered inconsequential. Ma is able to play with the 
	same feel as Hoots; Their differences still exist, but those which can 
	be ascribed to racial determinism are rendered obviously false. All 
	kinds can play together and differences are a source of generative 
	exploration and comparison rather than self/other mutual distrust. This
	skit might also be read as an elevation of jazz and blues as art forms 
	on par with classical music. In this regard, it seems to be speaking 
	directly to the divide between Grosse Pointe and 148th street which 
	Rapso described. Difference, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in part }\DIFdelend with the help of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{multifaceted 
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{virtuosic listening and 
	}\DIFaddend musical performance, can blossom into mutual understanding.


	\subsection*{Interiority and the limits of understanding}

	It is worth noting that in the beginning of this skit while Ma is 
	practicing his face is expressive, his eyes are closed, and he has no 
	written music. He is completely absorbed in this recitation from memory.
	This appears to be a cultivation of the image of interiority. Compare
	this to 19th century reviews of pianist Arabella Goddard which were 
	impressed that she played from memory,\autocite{Goddard} or the more 
	contemporary film promo of ``the last romantic'' Vladimir Horowitz, in 
	which he records canonic works almost entirely without consulting the 
	scores. Playing without \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{written }\DIFaddend music has long been considered an act of
	virtuosity in the classical \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{music }\DIFdelend performance canon. It is an outward 
	expression of interiority, both in the idea that the music is now 
	completely contained within the performer, and that their practicing and
	performing are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{necessarily }\DIFdelend concerned not with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{just }\DIFaddend playing the notes, but 
	with capturing the emotional and spiritual aspects of the piece which 
	are not contained in the printed music. 

	In playing classical music without a printed page, and then playing 
	along with Hoots's soulful saxophone crooning, Ma's interiority is 
	established both in the classical sense and in terms of the ``feel'' and
	``soul'' celebrated in jazz, blues, and related art forms which make 
	significant use of extemporaneous performance. This multi-cultural 
	interiority, the ability for the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supposed }\DIFaddend universality of music to 
	transcend 
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{genera and culture establishes virtuosity as }\textit{\DIFadd{virtuous}}\DIFadd{.
	}\DIFaddend The logic goes that if virtuosity means universality and universality is
	morally good, then so is virtuosity. This takes Joe Rapso's hope that 
	the music on \textit{Sesame Street} would have a socially cohesive 
	function even farther. By not only knowing diverse music, but taking 
	part in it, one becomes an ideal global citizen who speaks not in broken
	English, Chinese, and Persian, but in that fabled lingua franca, Music.   
	This raises the question of what is actually accomplished by the ethos
	of understanding seen on \ses and other public media, and what is
	essentially virtue signaling. Ma expresses his virtuous virtuosity and 
	liberal understanding by playing jazz, Hoots, on the other hand, is 
	given no such versatility. Ma is presented as skilled, flexible, and 
	intellectual, while hoots, despite his talent, is rooted in a single 
	tradition. In this way, the classical musician is able to co-opt Black 
	musicality and in so doing establish his moral high-standing through 
	liberal omnivory. 

	This is the limit of public-media style understanding. In this skit, 
	classical music and jazz are placed side-by-side. At once it looks like
	an act of leveling, where each music is presented as complete in its own
	right. However, this utopic world of fun and play covers up the long 
	history of epistemological violence that the classical music and white 
	musical establishments have enacted upon the music of the African 
	diaspora. In this way, understanding stems from erasure and omission.

	These are the limits of understanding. Understanding is itself 
	insufficient for the utopia that \ses presents if it leads no further 
	than understanding \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alone}\DIFaddend . Understanding must come from a place which 
	leads to
	 action, lest understanding simply lead to more understanding. 
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{That is 
	the limitation of liberal understanding. }\DIFdelend Empathy can be offered in a 
	broadcast, but if this empathy is used only to establish one's status 
	as a virtuous, educated, middle-class subject, then it only exists to 
	re-establish class boundaries: middle class people who understand 
	versus working-class people who do not.  

	That said, listening can itself be a radical and repairative action when
	it comes from an awareness of our listening positionality: listening 
	\textit{with}, rather than simply listening. The Ma and Hoots skit 
	displays something somewhere in between, as Ma listens, and listens to 
	himself being listened to by Hoots. However, the relationship is 
	asymmetrical. Other skits on the program, such as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the Issac Perlman}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Issac Perlman's 
	}\DIFaddend ``what's hard for you'' appearance present a more symmetrically mutual 
	listening. And this is where understanding on \ses differs from 
	understanding on NPR and \textit{All Things Considered}. On NPR, in the
	world of the public radio sound, one can only listen as common folk 
	speak into the microphone of the unacknowledged reporter. On 
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ses}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{Sesame Street}}\DIFaddend , 
	however, the child viewer is given numerous models of fair and radical 
	co-mutual listening. While the Ma example falls short \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the program's 
	other more symmetrical and effective examples of listening}\DIFaddend , the basic 
	premise
	of the idea is there: careful \textit{listening with} is an active
	decision which can lead to the healing of deep historical wounds, 
	divides, and misunderstandings.
